## Packaging it all up

Once the circuit has been tested, you can wire up the components directly to the Raspberry Pi as shown below.

-  Place a leg of the LDR and the long leg of the capacitor into a female-to-female jumper lead, then tape it up.

-  Place jumper leads on the remaining legs, then plug it all back into the Raspberry Pi.

You can place the Raspberry Pi and components in a housing to conceal them if you wish. Here we have used a plastic box with a hole made in it for the straw:

-  Place your container near a doorway and then affix the laser pointer to the wall, so the beam is focused down the straw.
-  Now run the code and test your laser tripwire.

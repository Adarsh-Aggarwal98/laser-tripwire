## Light-dependent resistors (LDRs)

An LDR (sometimes called a photocell) is a special type of resistor.

When light hits the LDR, its resistance is very low, but when it's in the dark its resistance is very high.

By placing a capacitor in series with an LDR, the capacitor will charge at different speeds depending on whether it's light or dark.

## What you will make
In this resource you will make a laser tripwire, using a laser pointer and a Raspberry Pi.

## What you will learn
By creating a laser tripwire with your Raspberry Pi, you will learn:

- How to use GPIO pins
- How to create a circuit on a breadboard
- Controlling GPIO pins with Python code and GPIO Zero
- How to use a capacitor to get readings from analogue sensors

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)

## Introduction

In this resource you will use a laser pointer, a few electronic components, and a Raspberry Pi to make a laser tripwire. Each time a stealthy intruder breaks the laser beam, the Raspberry Pi will sound the alarm via a buzzer or a speaker.

By completing this project you will learn how to:

   - Measure light levels with an LDR
   - Control a buzzer
   - Play sounds using the PyGame Python module
   - Write and call simple lambda functions

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum:

  - [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
  - [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)

:END:
This is a quick guide to creating a Laser-tripwire with a Raspberry Pi.
** Equipment
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: equipment
:END: 
1. A Raspberry Pi (any model will do, but wiring may vary)
2. A Laser Pointer
3. A Breadboard
4. Female-Male and Female-Female Jumper leads
5. A Piezo Buzzer
6. An LDR
7. A 1Î¼F Capacitor
** The Circuit

** Code

:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: scripts
:END: 
#+begin_src python
  from gpiozero import LightSensor, Buzzer
  from time import sleep

  ldr = LightSensor(4)  # alter if using a different pin
  buzzer = Buzzer(17)  # alter if using a different pin

  while True:
      sleep(0.1)
      if ldr.value < 0.5:  # adjust this to make the circuit more or less sensitive
          buzzer.on()
          # uncomment the next line to have the alarm trigger for 30 seconds.
          # sleep(30) 
      else:
          buzzer.off()
#+end_src

** Instruction

:END: 
1. Wire up the Raspberry Pi and components as shown in the diagram above.
2. Write the code as shown above and run.
3. With the laser pointer aimed at the LDR, the buzzer should be off. If the beam is broken the buzzer should come on.
4. You can alter the triggering ldr value in the code.
5. It may help to surround the LDR with a cut-down drinking straw, to block out some ambient light.
6. Once the circuit has been tested, you can wire up the components directly to the Raspberry Pi as shown below. (Soldering will increase the longevity of the project).

7. You can place the Raspberry Pi and components in a housing to conceal them if you wish.
